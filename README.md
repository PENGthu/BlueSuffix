Code for Papar ["BlueSuffix: Reinforced Blue Teaming for Vision-Language Models Against Jailbreak Attacks"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20971). 

We currently provide the code for the three components of BlueSuffix. For the fine-tuned Suffix Generator, we will provide in the future.
 
## ðŸ“Œ Abstract

In this paper, we focus on black-box defense for VLMs against jailbreak attacks.Existing black-box defense methods are either unimodal or bimodal. Unimodal methods enhance either the vision or language module of the VLM, while bimodal methods robustify the model through text-image representation realignment. However, these methods suffer from two limitations: 1) they fail to fully exploit the cross-modal information, or 2) they degrade the model performance on benign inputs. To address these limitations, we propose a novel blue-team method BlueSuffix that defends target VLMs against jailbreak attacks without compromising its performance under black-box setting. BlueSuffix includes three key components: 1) a visual purifier against jailbreak images, 2) a textual purifier against jailbreak texts, and 3) a blue-team suffix generator using reinforcement fine-tuning for enhancing cross-modal robustness. We empirically show on four VLMs (LLaVA, MiniGPT-4, InstructionBLIP, and Gemini) and four safety benchmarks (Harmful Instruction, AdvBench, MM-SafetyBench, and RedTeam-2K) that BlueSuffix outperforms the baseline defenses by a significant margin. Our BlueSuffix opens up a promising direction for defending VLMs against jailbreak attacks.

# Usage

## Requirements

Python 3.11.5

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Model depolyment

Please following the offcial guidelines.

[1]LLaVA: https://github.com/haotian-liu/LLaVA

[2]MiniGPT: https://github.com/Vision-CAIR/MiniGPT-4

## Image Purifier

```
cd Image_Purifier

python image_purifier.py --config configs/diffpure.yml --log_dir path/to/your/fold
```
The code of Image Purifier is based on [DiffPure](https://github.com/NVlabs/DiffPure).

## Text Purifier

```
python text_purifier.py
```
The Text Purifier needs to call the GPT API.

## Suffix Generator
Before fine-tuning, deploying target VLM is needed.

```
python ppo_blue_team.py
```
